ABR_client
==========

Android App used to connect to a TCP server (ABR_server) and allow streaming of data and remote control.

Start and connect Android client to the server using the IP address of the server and port number (e.g. 9000).

Good example to see how you can connect and send/receive data to/from a TCP server, send data over UDP sockets, 
capture frames from the phone's camera for streaming.
